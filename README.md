## Problem Statement

In urban environments, maintaining optimal plant health can be challenging due to varying environmental conditions and inconsistent care. GreenSage addresses these challenges by providing a sophisticated plant monitoring and care system that ensures plants receive the precise conditions they need to thrive.

### Current Issues and Plant Status

| Plant         | Status          | Notes                                    |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Plant 1       | Dead            | Soil moisture below optimal levels       |
| Plant 2       | Healthy         | Well-maintained environment              |
| Plant 3       | Struggling      | Needs adjustment in light exposure       |
| Plant 4       | Dormant         | Seasonal adaptation                      |

## Technology Stack

GreenSage leverages a diverse technology stack to ensure robust plant monitoring and care:

| Technology      | Description                               |

| Golang          | Backend development                        |
| Dart            | Language for mobile app development        |
| Flutter         | UI framework for cross-platform apps       |
| Arduino         | Microcontroller for sensor integration     |
| Moisture Sensor | Measures soil moisture levels              |
| Temperature Sensor | Monitors ambient temperature           |
| Humidity Sensor | Tracks humidity levels in the environment  |

## Plant Health Predictions

GreenSage provides predictions for plant health based on environmental data and machine learning algorithms:

| Plant         | Predicted Health     | Prediction Confidence   |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Plant 1       | Poor                 | 60%                     |
| Plant 2       | Excellent            | 85%                     |
| Plant 3       | Fair                 | 70%                     |
| Plant 4       | Good                 | 75%                     |
